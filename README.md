# ATMega128 Simple FreeRTOS project

This repository uses the [ATMega128 embedded board](http://www.devicemart.co.kr/goods/view?no=32749&NaPm=ct%3Djxr7itzj%7Cci%3Dcheckout%7Ctr%3Dppc%7Ctrx%3D%7Chk%3D5152996465a38d046904b5ddd92334f551f6ac6e)
which is great to learn about the embedded board system.
I use the below picture's embedded board.

This project not only uses ATMega128 but also uses [FreeRTOS](https://www.freertos.org/) which is the best open source real-time operating system.
If you want to find the specific function, then I strongly recommend this repository's tags and my [wiki](https://github.com/BlaCkinkGJ/Atmega128-SimpleProject-FreeRTOS/wiki/Abstraction)
